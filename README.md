# Advent of Code 2023
I initially wanted to learn Ocaml, but when I tried preparing for AOC, I quickly found that the tooling around the language is just not up to par yet with F# (which is sad, because I am really rooting for Ocaml to become a fast language so functional programming can be used in more contexts, but I digress). Because I still wanted to use functional programming, I fell back on F#, which has excellent tooling I must admit. I still don't like the fact that it is based on DotNet framework as it is clearly treated as an afterthought (many functions still use exceptions and C# syntax), but with FSharpPlus, which has FP wrappers for many of these functions, it becomes quite a pleasant and fun language to work with.
